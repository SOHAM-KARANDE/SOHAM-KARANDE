[cite_start]I'm an AI/ML Engineer and Creative Technologist based in Pune, India[cite: 308]. [cite_start]My passion lies in crafting intelligent systems that simplify complexities and make technology feel more human[cite: 309]. [cite_start]I believe AI is more than just code; it's about creating adaptive, evolving systems that can think, learn, and connect[cite: 310].

[cite_start]From developing agentic AI solutions to fine-tuning generative pipelines, I thrive at the intersection of intelligence and user experience[cite: 311]. [cite_start]My work aims to bridge the gap between computational power and intuitive design, building digital assistants, creative tools, and automation systems that genuinely understand and empower users[cite: 312].
