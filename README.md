## Hey there! I'm Soham Karande

I'm an AI/ML Engineer and Creative Technologist based in Pune, India. My passion lies in crafting intelligent systems that simplify complexities and make technology feel more human. I believe AI is more than just code; it's about creating adaptive, evolving systems that can think, learn, and connect.

From developing agentic AI solutions to fine-tuning generative pipelines, I thrive at the intersection of intelligence and user experience. My work aims to bridge the gap between computational power and intuitive design, building digital assistants, creative tools, and automation systems that genuinely understand and empower users.
