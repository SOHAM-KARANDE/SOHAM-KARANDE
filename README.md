## 🧠 About Me – Bringing AI to Life

I’m Soham Datta, an AI/ML Engineer and Creative Technologist based in Pune, India. My mission is to design intelligent systems that *automate complexity* and make technology feel more alive—more human. I believe AI isn't just about code—it's about crafting adaptive, evolving systems that think, learn, and resonate. 

From building agentic AI solutions to fine-tuning generative pipelines, I operate at the intersection of intelligence and experience. My work bridges the gap between raw computational power and intuitive design—shaping digital assistants, creative tools, and automation systems that truly *understand* users.
